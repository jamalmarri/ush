Testing SIGINT ... your shell should not stop running
Now ush will run interactively, you should be able to type sleep 100
and then hit control-C, sleep should terminate and you should be
able to type more commands to ush and they should work. Exit the
shell when done testing sigint
% You fail SIGINT.
