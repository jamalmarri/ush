Testing errors with /home/phil/public/csci347/testa3/ush.err and 5 arguments (should be 5)
Initial arguments are arg1, arg2, arg3, and arg4.
Doing a shift of 4 (no error)
We now have 1 argument, arg1 is ''.
Doing a shift of 4 and 1 (should be errors)
Not enough arguments to shift 4.
Not enough arguments to shift 1.
Now doing 'unshift 5' (should be an error)
Only shifted 4 right now. Can't unshift.
Did an unshift ... number of args is 5, should be 5.
