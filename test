echo --- Testing basic exit value reporting ---
echo
echo - Exiting sh with value 14
sh -c "exit 14"
echo - Shell exited with value $?
echo - Exiting sh with no value
sh -c exit
echo - Shell exited with value $?
echo - Testing normal case cd
cd .
echo - cd returned $?
echo - Testing cd with non-existant directory
cd doesnotexist
echo - cd returned $?
echo - Testing sstat with all valid names
sstat ush/Makefile ush/defn.h ush/ush.c ush/expand.c ush/builtin.c ush/strmode.c
echo - sstat returned $?
echo - Testing sstat with a non-existant file
sstat ush/Makefile ush/defn.h doesnotexist
echo - sstat returned $?
echo
echo --- Testing signal reporting from children ---
echo --- NOTE: using sigexit program to simulate signals
echo
echo - Testing signal 3
./sigexit 3
echo - Testing signal 11
./sigexit 11
echo - Testing signal 13
./sigexit 13
echo - Testing signal 14
./sigexit 14
echo - Testing signal 127
./sigexit 127
echo
echo --- Testing command expansion ---
echo --- NOTE: using '\' to prevent expansion on informative echo calls
echo --- the '\' does not actually appear in the executed commands
echo
echo - Doing echo $\(echo Hello world!)
echo $(echo Hello world!)
echo - Doing echo $\(echo Hello) $\(echo world!)
echo $(echo Hello) $(echo world!)
echo - Doing echo $\(echo $\(echo $\(echo Hello world!)))
echo $(echo $(echo $(echo Hello world!)))
echo
echo --- Testing signal catching
echo --- NOTE: using sigexit program to simulate ^C
echo
echo - Running sigexit with -1
./sigexit -1
echo - No output should have printed from sigexit
echo
echo --- Testing pipelines
echo
echo - Testing pipe from ps aux to grep init
ps aux | grep init
echo - Testing pipe from ps aux to grep init to grep -v grep
ps aux | grep init | grep -v grep
echo - Testing previous pipe within a command expansion
echo $(ps aux | grep init | grep -v grep)
echo - Output should be the same as last command (except the spacing)
echo - Testing if exit value is only affected by the last command in the pipeline
cd doesnotexist | cat
echo - Error should have occured. Exit value is $?. Should be 0.
