--- NOTE: using sigexit program to simulate signals

- Testing signal 3
Quit
- Testing signal 11
Segmentation fault
- Testing signal 13
Broken pipe
- Testing signal 14
Alarm clock

--- Testing command expansion ---
--- NOTE: using '\' to prevent expansion on informative echo calls
--- the '\' does not actually appear in the executed commands

- Doing echo $\(echo Hello world!)
Hello world!
- Doing echo $\(echo Hello) $\(echo world!)
Hello world!
- Doing echo $\(echo $\(echo $\(echo Hello world!)))
Hello world!

--- Testing signal catching
--- NOTE: using sigexit program to simulate ^C

- Running sigexit with -1
- No output should have printed from sigexit

--- Testing pipelines

- Testing pipe from ps aux to grep init
root         1  0.0  0.0 226792  7764 ?        Ss   Mar30   7:21 /sbin/init splash
marrij   20170  0.0  0.0  21532  1120 pts/19   S+   21:05   0:00 grep init
- Testing pipe from ps aux to grep init to grep -v grep
root         1  0.0  0.0 226792  7764 ?        Ss   Mar30   7:21 /sbin/init splash
- Testing previous pipe within a command expansion
root 1 0.0 0.0 226792 7764 ? Ss Mar30 7:21 /sbin/init splash
- Output should be the same as last command (except the spacing)
- Testing if exit value is only affected by the last command in the pipeline
chdir: No such file or directory
- Error should have occured. Exit value is 0. Should be 0.
